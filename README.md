🚀 Interstellar Game
Interstellar Game is a project developed in Java using the Processing library. The game aims to reinforce concepts of game development, programming logic, and graphical interactivity, with a strong focus on code structure best practices and user experience.

🎮 About the Game
The player controls a spaceship that must collect crystals while avoiding meteors. With bonus mechanics and progressively increasing difficulty, the game encourages skills such as quick decision-making, strategic planning, and precise movement.

🛠️ Key Concepts Explored
✔️ Flow control (conditional structures and loops)
✔️ Graphics and image manipulation (sprites and backgrounds)
✔️ Event handling (keyboard and mouse interactions)
✔️ Code organization into functions and classes for clarity and maintainability
