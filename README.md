ðŸš€ Interstellar Game Interstellar Game is a project developed in Java using the Processing library. The game is a practical exercise focused on reinforcing game development concepts, programming logic, and graphical interactivity, with an emphasis on good code structure practices and user experience.  In this game, the player controls a spaceship that needs to collect crystals and avoid collisions with meteors. With bonus mechanics and progressively increasing difficulty, the game encourages skills such as quick decision-making, planning, and precision in movement.  The project explores concepts like:  Flow control (conditional structures and loops) Graphics and image manipulation (sprites and backgrounds) Event management (keyboard and mouse) Code organization into functions and classes for clarity and maintainability
